## Introduction
This is a public code repository as open source for students and new learner about this things.

I created a full Realtime Chat Application. I'm going to use React on the front end and Bootstrap, with NodeJS Loopback-API + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

# Setup:
- Download Full Project
- Copy all file from `src` directory from chat-application
- Create new react app in your machine
- Then replace new app src folder with `chat-application/src` files.
- Use NodeJS + LoopBack to configure the backend. Try google to install both technology.
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
